::: warning
The Platform.sh plugin is currently unsupported, so YMMV.

# Platform.sh

[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) is an end-to-end web platform for agile teams.

This Lando integration is currently **unsupported**. If your team is interested in sponsoring the integration, [contact us](./support.md)! For now...

* This should be considered at an `beta` level of readiness
* This has only been tested against Platform.sh's `php` project templates
* This currently _only_ supports Platform.sh's `php` application container
* It's not yet clear how much customization to your project is currently supported

However, if you'd like to try it out and give your feedback on what worked and what didn't then please continue. You can also read about some more caveats [here](./caveats.md).

You can report any issues or feedback [over here](https://github.com/lando/platformsh/issues/new/choose) or check out the [support page](./support.md).
