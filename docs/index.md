# Platform.sh

[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) is the end-to-end web platform for agile teams. With it you can build, evolve, and scale your website fleetâ€”with zero infrastructure management investment. Get hosting, CI/CD, automated updates, global 24x7 support. And much more.

This Lando integration is currently in development and as such it has the following _serious caveats_:

* This should be considered at an `beta` level of readiness
* This has only been tested against Platform.sh's `php` project templates
* This currently _only_ supports Platform.sh's `php` application container
* It's not yet clear how much customization to your project is currently supported

However, if you'd like to try it out and give your feedback on what worked and what didn't then please continue. You can also read about some more caveats [here](./caveats.md).

You can report any issues or feedback [over here](https://github.com/lando/platformsh/issues/new/choose) or check out the [support page](./support.md).
